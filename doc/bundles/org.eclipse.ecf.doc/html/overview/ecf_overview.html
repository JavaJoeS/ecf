<h2>Eclipse Communication Framework Overview</h2>
    The Eclipse Communication Framework (ECF) 
    provides APIs that simplify the creation of interoperable, extensible, reliable distributed applications.
    The framework is useful for aiding the creation of plugins, tools, 
    or full <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rcp">Eclipse RCP</a> applications, that require 
    client-server and/or peer-to-peer messaging and communications.  
    <br> <br>
    ECF also provides a simple-but-general component model for distributed applications,
    and a growing library of reusable components for this component model.  Communications components such as 
    service lookup and discovery, presence and instant messaging, file sharing, pub/sub messaging, and others are provided by the 
    framework and third parties, which may be used/reused by developers for creating communication-enabled tools and applications.
    <br><br>
    Further, using ECF extension points, programmers can easily extend ECF itself by implementing an 'ECF protocol provider'.  
    Such custom implementations allow interoperability with any desired (proprietary or open) communications protocols.  
    <br><br>Finally, ECF also provides fully functional example applications using these APIs...such as XMPP (Jabber) Instant
    Messaging/chat, file and URL-sharing, real-time model sharing, and collaborative editing.
