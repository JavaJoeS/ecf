<h2>Introduction: ECF Communication via Shared Object Containers</h2>
<p> The two fundamental concepts in ECF are the <b>SharedObjectContainer</b>
and the <b>SharedObject</b>. SharedObjectContainers provide a specific
<b><i>communications context</i></b> for contained SharedObject
instances. The context provided by ECF SharedObjectContainers allows
contained SharedObjects to communicate with a group of remote processes
using protocols provided by the container. <br>
<br>
In the ECF model, SharedObjects represent communications components or
whole communications applications. Components use container-provided
messaging to implement their necessary communications, but are
completely free to implement whatever other functionality is required.
All a given ECF component must do is implement a single interface
(org.eclipse.ecf.core.ISharedObject), and add itself/be added to some
instance of a container. <br>
<br>
ECF itself defines the basic required interfaces for
SharedObjectContainers and SharedObjects. ECF also provides
implementations of various common communications protocols, in the form
of specific type of containers, and various sorts of application-level
communications (e.g conferencing or chat) via communications components
implemented as SharedObjects. <br>
<br>
In some respects, the ECF container/shared object design resembles the
design of other container architectures such a Servlet container. The
difference, however, is that the ECF container model is based upon a
group model of communication rather than client/server, where a given
shared object can communicate with one or many remote processes either
asynchronously and/or synchronously with a single primitive. </p>
