<h1>Eclipse Communication Framework</h1>
<p> The Eclipse Communication Framework (ECF) is a project to enable
the creation of communications applications on the Eclipse Platform.
The framework provides APIs for secure asynchronous and synchronous
messaging to deliver human-to-human, human-to-plugin, and
plugin-to-plugin communications and collaboration. <br>
<br>
ECF is intended to support three types of plugin developers: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Developers of communications <b>applications</b> (end-user
visible complete applications).</li>
  <li>Developers of communications <b>components</b> (communications
features designed to be reused among multiple applications)</li>
  <li>Communications <b>infrastructure developers</b> (providers of
standard and/or proprietary communications protocols...e.g. SIP/SIMPLE,
XMPP, JMS, JXTA, etc)</li>
</ol>
ECF provides open, secure APIs and extension points so that others may
easily build applications, reusable communications components, or
extend the framework itself in order to interoperate via standard
and/or proprietary communications protocols. <br>
<br>
The ECF project will also provide complete demonstration and example
applications such as Eclipse project team instant messaging/chat, data
and voice conferencing, application sharing, real-time and asynchronous
model sharing, and team access to web-based services such as Really
Simple Syndication (RSS) and Weblogs.
