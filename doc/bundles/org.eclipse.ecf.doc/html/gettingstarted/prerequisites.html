<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<p>ECF plugins will be built in Java and will be portable to any
platform supported by Eclipse. For components that might not run on
Eclipse (e.g. servers), all ECF-created code will be built to depend
only upon pure Java Standard Edition (1.4+). We also will look to
support OSGI Foundation as a minimum runtime platform.</p>
<p>You will need the following already installed on your machine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java version 1.4.2 or newer...1.5 OK also
    <pre>java version "1.4.2_04"<br>Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_04-b05)<br>Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2_04-b05, mixed model</pre>
  </li>
  <li> <a
 href="http://download.eclipse.org/downloads/drops/S-3.1M4-200412162000/index.php">Eclipse
version 3.1M4</a><br>
    <br>
Earlier Eclipse Platform versions may work, but we have not tested them.<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li> <a
 href="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/emf/scripts/downloads.php">EMF
SDK 2.1.0 (still on integration builds)</a><br>
    <br>
The EMF SDK is needed to use the shared datagraph editor, and will be
needed for SETO. It is <b>not</b>
needed to be able to use the other ECF application-level features
(chat, url sharing, etc). It is needed to in order to compile the
entire ECF source base. </li>
</ul>
