The use of the TimeServiceHost.jgroups.zeroconf.product relies on the presence of the 
org.eclipse.ecf.provider.jgroups distribution provider.  This bundle is available 
as described here:  https://wiki.eclipse.org/Distribution_Providers

It also assumes that an etcd server is running on localhost at port 2379.  The system properties
in the product config are currently set to localhost and port 2379 via:

-Decf.discovery.etcd.hostname=localhost
-Decf.discovery.etcd.port=2379

These can be changed in the product config or the generated launch config if desired to
point at some other etcd server.
