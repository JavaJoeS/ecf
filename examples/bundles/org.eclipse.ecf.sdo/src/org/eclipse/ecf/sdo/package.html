<p>Provides the ability to share structured data graphs among Shared
Object Containers joined in the same group. The shared data graphs must
comply with the Service Data Objects API.</p>
<h2>Package Specification</h2>
<p>This package provides the API to support replication of structured
object state (represented by SDO data graphs) across multiple
processes. Specifically, it allows the clients to:</p>
<ol>
  <li>publish SDO data graphs to the group, thus making them available
for subscription</li>
  <li>subscribe to data graphs published by other group members</li>
</ol>
<p>Subsequently, both publishers and subscribers are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>able to commit changes they make locally, thus making them
visible to the whole group</li>
  <li>notified when other group members make changes</li>
</ol>
<p>In terms of SDO, the group (or network) acts as a Data Mediator to
clients committing a change. That is, the network logs any changes that
are made to the data graph by the client between commits. When the
client commits, the network uses the data graph's Change Summary to
determine what has changed and make it available to other group members
(the specifics of how this is done depend on the chosen
implementation).
</p>
<p>When a client listens to changes from the network, the client itself
acts as a Data Mediator to the network; that is, the client logs any
changes that are made to the data graph by the network between updates.
When an update is received, the client is notified and may use the data
graph's Change Summary to determine what has changed (at which point it
may process the changes in an application-specific manner).
</p>
<p>In the generic case, a client may both commit and receive updates at
the same time; it may make changes to the local data graph (with the
intention to commit at some point) and decide what to do when a remote
update is received (e.g., it may choose to discard its local changes,
or merge them in, etc.)
</p>
<p>To get started, the client must have a container instance and make
sure it is connected (i.e., part of a group) before changes can be made
and/or received. With this the client may obtain the service facade,
which will allow it to publish/subscribe to data graphs; for instance:
</p>
<pre>ISharedObjectContainer container = &lt;container instance&gt;;<br>IDataGraphSharing svc = SDOPlugin.getDefault().getDataGraphSharing(container);<br>// publish existing data graph instance<br>ISharedDataGraph sharedDataGraph = svc.publish(dataGraph, id, provider, consumer);<br>// --OR-- subscribe to a published data graph<br>ISharedDataGraph sharedDataGraph = svc.subscribe(id, callback, provider, consumer);<br>DataGraph dataGraph = sharedDataGraph.getDataGraph();<br>// make changes to the data graph<br>// ...<br>sharedDataGraph.commit();<br></pre>
<p>Notes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>the container need not be connected until publications or
subscriptions are attempted</li>
  <li>committing changes and receiving updates will not be possible
once the container disconnects</li>
  <li>data graph IDs must be unique within the given container</li>
</ul>
