Provides DataShare Service API. DataShare allows clients to engage in real-time 
collaborative sharing of arbitrary data.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>This package contains a set of interfaces that support a simple
protocol for real-time collaborative sharing of arbitrary data.
The client first obtains an implementation-specific {@link org.eclipse.ecf.datashare.DataShareService DataShareService},
which allows it to {@link DataShareService#joinSession join} a data sharing {@link org.eclipse.ecf.datashare.Session session}.
The client may participate in the session by means of a {@link org.eclipse.ecf.datashare.Participant Participant},
an instance of which it must supply to the service when joining the session. The participant instance is then
fully managed by the service -- it is {@link Participant#initialize initialized} with a {@link Session session} instance
and any initial data, it {@link Participant#receive receives} updates from others, and
{@link Session#send sends} its own updates using the session. It may choose
to {@link Session#leave leave} the session, or may otherwise be disconnected from it,
at which point it will be {@link Participant#dispose disposed}.</p>

<p>The service makes no assumptions about the particular data representation or
the protocol that may be employed to keep the distributed copies synchronized.
The client is free to use any synchronization semantics it finds appropriate for the application.</p>
